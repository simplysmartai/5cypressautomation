## Slide 2: The Problem

### Manual Order Processing is Holding You Back

**Current State:**
- ⏱️ 15-30 minutes per order (form → invoice → shipping → inventory)
- ❌ 5-10% error rate (wrong quantities, incorrect addresses, inventory mismatches)
- 📈 Doesn't scale (more orders = hire more people)
- 🔮 Zero visibility (can't see bottlenecks in real-time)

**Cost:**
- 50 orders/month = 16.7 hours = **$417/month**
- 200 orders/month = 66.7 hours = **$1,668/month**

*Manual processes don't scale. Automation does.*

---

## Slide 3: The Opportunity

### Why Now is the Perfect Time

**You're Still Setting Up Systems**

✅ **Build it right from the start** (vs. fix it later)  
✅ **No technical debt to untangle**  
✅ **Architect for scale from day one**  
✅ **Establish relationships during setup**

**The Alternative:**
- ❌ Build manual processes first
- ❌ Realize they don't scale at 6 months
- ❌ Pay 3x more to retrofit automation later
- ❌ Lose 6 months of productivity

*The best time to automate is during setup, not after chaos.*

---

## Slide 4: The Solution

### Fully Automated Order Fulfillment

**One Workflow, Five Systems Connected:**

```
Form Submission
    ↓
QuickBooks Invoice (auto-created)
    ↓
Shipping Order (auto-created with label)
    ↓
Inventory Update (real-time stock tracking)
    ↓
Customer Email (confirmation with tracking)
```

**Processing Time:** 20 minutes → **30 seconds**  
**Error Rate:** 5% → **<0.1%**  
**Scalability:** 10 orders or 10,000 orders → **Same cost**

---

## Slide 5: How It Works

**Phase 2: Full Automation (Week 3-4)**
- Fully hands-off shipping order creation
- Real-time inventory updates
- Low stock alerts via Slack
