### Email 1: The "Manual Entry Tax" (Day 1)
**Subject:** [First Name], the manual entry tax is costing [Company] 15 hours/week

Hi [First Name],

Most Operations Managers at [Industry] firms tell me their team spends 2-3 hours a day just re-typing customer data from forms into QuickBooks and shipping tools.

It’s not just slow—it’s a data integrity risk.

I built a 60-second proof for [Company] showing how we completely automate this:
1. Form submitted
2. QBO Invoice generated instantly
3. Shipping label ready for print
4. ROI logged to your dashboard

**Can I send you a 2-minute video showing how this works for your specific QBO setup?**

Best,

### Email 2: The "Self-Annealing" Difference (Day 3)
**Subject:** Why automation usually breaks (and why ours doesn't)

Hi [First Name],

The biggest fear with automation is that it breaks and leaves your team with a bigger mess than they started with.

At 5 Cypress, we use a "Self-Annealing" architecture. If an API connection flickers or a form entry is malformed, the system detects it, fixes it (or alerts us), and completes the job.

We're running a **30-Day Resiliency Trial** for 5 companies this month to prove it. $2,500 flat fee. We build your core Sales-to-QBO workflow and give you a real-time ROI dashboard.

**Worth a 10-minute chat to see if you qualify?** [Link to Calendly]

### Email 3: The "24-Hour Implementation" (Day 5)
**Subject:** Live in 24 hours?

Hi [First Name],

I know typical software integrations take months. We’ve streamlined our 5 Cypress core to be live in 24 hours.

If you’re ready to stop the "manual entry leak" before the end of the week, I have one slot left for our $2,500 priority trial program. 

**Shall we get your first automated invoice out tomorrow?**

Best,
[Your Name]
