# Email Sequence: The 24-Hour Fix (Missed Call Text-Back)

**Persona:** Direct, results-oriented, local GA professional. No fluff.

## Email 1: The "Local Discovery" (Initial Outreach)
**Subject:** Quick question for {{business_name}} (near {{city}})
**Subject Alt:** Do you get a text when you miss a call?

Hi {{owner_name}},

I was looking at {{business_name}} online and noticed you're right here near 30022. 

Quick question: If a new patient/client calls you after hours or while your front desk is busy and stays on the line until it hits voicemail—do they get an immediate text back from you?

Data shows 62% of local business calls go to voicemail. Usually, that person just hangs up and calls the next listing on Google.

I’m helping a few businesses in {{city}} set up **"The 24-Hour Fix."** 

It’s an automated system that instantly texts back every missed call: *"Hey, it’s {{business_name}}. Sorry we missed you—how can we help?"*

It takes 15 minutes to sync, costs $500 once, and prevents high-ticket leads from calling your competitors.

Are you open to a 2-minute "test call" to see how it works on your own phone?

Best,

## Email 2: The "Quick Win" (24-48 Hours Later)
**Subject:** 24 hours to live

Hi {{owner_name}},

Checking back on this. 

Most automation projects take months and cost thousands. This is the opposite. I call it a "Quick Win" because we can have it live for {{business_name}} in under 24 hours with zero downtime.

**The Niche Hook (Swap based on lead):**
*   **Med Spa:** A missed "CoolSculpting" or "Injectables" inquiry is a $1,000+ loss.
*   **Dental:** Emergency patients don't wait for a callback; they call the next office.
*   **Real Estate:** Lead response speed is the #1 factor in conversion.
*   **Home Services:** You’re likely losing 2-3 jobs a week simply because you were on a roof or driving when the phone rang.

For a flat $500 setup, you stop the bleeding.

Worth a quick chat this week?

Best,

Nick

## Email 3: The "Demo Offer" (4-5 Days Later)
**Subject:** Re: {{business_name}} / Missed calls

{{owner_name}},

I'll head out of your inbox after this one.

I put together a 1-page breakdown of how the Missed Call Text-Back system works for businesses in {{city}}. It shows the exact ROI math (usually pays for itself with the first saved booking).

Would you like me to send that over, or should I touch base in a few months when you're less busy?

Best,
