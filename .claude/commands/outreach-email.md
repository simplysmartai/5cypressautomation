Generate a cold outreach email for a potential client.

## Target
$ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

1. **Research the target** (if URL/company name provided):
   - What do they sell/do?
   - What's their likely pain point?
   - Any recent news or growth signals?

2. **Choose the right angle**:
   - Manual invoicing pain → QuickBooks automation
   - Inventory issues → Real-time sync
   - Shipping delays → ShipStation integration
   - Growing fast → "Scale without hiring ops"

3. **Write the email** following this structure:
   - Subject: [Specific pain] for [Company Name]
   - Line 1: Show you researched them
   - Line 2-3: Their problem (use their language)
   - Line 4: How you solve it + proof
   - Line 5: Clear CTA (calendar link)

4. **Keep it under 150 words**

Hi [Name],

Congrats on the growth - 500+ orders/month is no small feat!

At that volume, I'm guessing you're spending hours on invoicing
and inventory updates. That's time you could spend on new products.

We automate the order→QuickBooks→shipping flow for Etsy sellers.
One client cut their admin time from 8 hours to 30 minutes weekly.

Worth a 15-min call to see if this fits?

Best,

Quick tip for high-volume Etsy sellers

Whether we chat or not: QuickBooks can auto-flag low inventory
items. Takes 5 min to set up. Happy to show you if helpful.
