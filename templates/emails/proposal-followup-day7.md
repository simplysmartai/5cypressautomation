# Email: Proposal Follow-up (Day 7)

**Subject:** Ready to move forward?

---

Hi {{first_name}},

Wanted to circle back on the automation proposal. Are you ready to move forward, or is there anything holding you back?

If timing isn't right, totally understand — just let me know and I'll check back in later.

If you're ready, reply "let's go" and I'll send the contract today.

Best,

P.S. — If budget is a concern, we could also start with a smaller pilot project to prove the value first.
