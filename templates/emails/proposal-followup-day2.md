# Email: Proposal Follow-up (Day 2)

**Subject:** Quick question about the proposal

Hi {{first_name}},

Just checking in — did you get a chance to look at the proposal I sent over?

No rush, but I wanted to make sure nothing got lost in the shuffle. Happy to hop on a quick call if any questions came up.

Best,
