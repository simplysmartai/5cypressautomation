Hi {{first_name}},

Great news — I've attached the contract for your review!

**What's included:**
- Master Service Agreement (our general terms)
- Statement of Work (your specific project details)

**To get started:**
1. Review both documents
2. Sign where indicated (electronic signature is fine)
3. Reply with signed copies attached

Once I receive the signed contract, I'll send the deposit invoice and we'll schedule your kickoff call.

**Timeline reminder:** We're looking at starting {{start_date}} with completion around {{completion_date}}.

Let me know if you have any questions about the terms.

Best,
