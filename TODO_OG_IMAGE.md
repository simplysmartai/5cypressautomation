# TODO: Create OG Image

## What's Needed

Create a social sharing image at `public/assets/brand/og-image.png`

### Specifications:
- **Dimensions**: 1200x630px (Facebook/LinkedIn standard)
- **Format**: PNG or JPG
- **File size**: Under 1MB
- **Content**:
  - "5 Cypress Automation" logo/branding
  - Tagline: "Your Business Tools Should Talk to Each Other"
  - Visual: Simple graphic showing tool connections (Calendly → QuickBooks → CRM)
  - Background: Dark theme matching site (#030304 with green accents)

### Current State:
- Meta tags already reference `https://5cypress.com/assets/brand/og-image.png`
- File doesn't exist yet - falls back to default preview
- SVG logo exists but won't render on social platforms

### Priority:
**Medium** - Site functions fine, but social shares look unprofessional without custom image

### Tools to Use:
- Canva (easiest)
- Figma
- Photoshop
- Or generate with AI (Midjourney, DALL-E)

### Once Created:
Upload to `public/assets/brand/og-image.png` and the meta tags are already configured.
