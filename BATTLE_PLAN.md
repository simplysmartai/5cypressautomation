# Strategic Battle Plan: 5 Cypress Automation → First Revenue

**Created:** February 5, 2026  
**Goal:** Close first paying client within 14 days  
**Strategy:** Stop planning, start shipping, use Opus 4.5 as force multiplier

---

## 🎯 The Core Problem

You've built an impressive system architecture, but you're stuck in "planning mode" because:

1. **No working demo** - Scripts have `# TODO` comments, no real API connections
2. **Too many options** - 10 packages, 20 directives, 67 plugins = paralysis
3. **No social proof** - Remy Lasers is still "prospecting" after 2 days
4. **Brand confusion** - Now resolved with unified "5 Cypress Automation" brand

**The fix:** Pick ONE thing, make it work, sell it, iterate.

---

## 🚀 Week 1: The "One Demo, One Client" Sprint

### Day 1-2: Make the Demo Actually Work

I created `execution/live_demo_automation.py` - a 60-second proof that shows:
- Form submission → Invoice → Shipping → Email → Tracking

**Your task:** Run it. Connect your real credentials. Show it to Remy Lasers.

```bash
# Set up .env with real credentials
QBO_CLIENT_ID=your_sandbox_key
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_USER=your_email
SMTP_PASS=your_app_password
DEMO_SHEET_ID=your_google_sheet_id

# Run the demo
python execution/live_demo_automation.py
```

### Day 3-4: Close Remy Lasers

They're already in your pipeline. The CFO meeting is overdue. Here's the play:

1. **Run the live demo** in the meeting (60 seconds proves you can deliver)
2. **Sign the $2,500 trial** (they're already expecting this price)
3. **Start building their workflow** (Week 2)

**Opus 4.5 Advantage:** Use me to:
- Generate the CFO presentation with ROI calculations
- Build their n8n workflow in hours, not days
- Write all the integration code for their specific stack

### Day 5-7: Document & Repeat

Once Remy Lasers signs:
1. Record everything for the directive (`trial_program_form_fulfillment.md`)
2. Create a case study (with their permission)
3. Find 2 more prospects using the same pitch

---

## 📦 The "One Package" Focus

Stop selling 10 packages. Sell ONE until you've delivered it 3 times.

**Your One Package:** Form-to-Fulfillment Automation ($2,500 trial)

Why this one?
- ✅ Already documented in `trial_program_form_fulfillment.md`
- ✅ Remy Lasers is already interested
- ✅ Clear deliverables (Microsoft Forms → QB → Shipping → Email)
- ✅ 30-day timeframe creates urgency
- ✅ $2,500 price applies to full engagement (no risk for client)

Everything else is distraction until you've closed 3 of these.

## 🛠 Opus 4.5 as Your Force Multiplier

Here's how to leverage me differently than other AI tools:

### 1. I Build, You Sell
Stop writing code yourself. Tell me:
- "Build the n8n workflow for Remy Lasers' order form"
- "Create the QuickBooks invoice integration"
- "Generate the client dashboard"

I'll write production-ready code. You focus on client relationships.

### 2. I Research, You Decide
Tell me:
- "Find 10 laser manufacturing companies in the US with CFOs on LinkedIn"
- "What's the best ShipStation API integration pattern?"
- "How do competitors price form-to-invoice automation?"

I'll do deep research. You make the strategic calls.

### 3. I Document, You Iterate
After each client engagement, tell me:
- "Update the trial program directive with what we learned"
- "Add the API rate limit workaround we discovered"
- "Create an onboarding checklist from this engagement"

The system gets smarter with every client.

## 💡 The Mindset Shift

**Old mode:** "I need to build all 10 packages before I can sell"  
**New mode:** "I sell one thing, build it with Opus 4.5 in days, repeat"

**Old mode:** "I need to understand every API before starting"  
**New mode:** "I'll figure it out as we go, with AI support"

**Old mode:** "What if I can't deliver?"  
**New mode:** "I have 67 agent plugins and a deterministic execution layer. I'll figure it out."

## 📞 Call to Action

Stop reading planning documents. Start this:

```bash
cd execution

Then message your prospect.

The only thing between you and revenue is action.
