# The 24-Hour Fix: Missed Call Text-Back
**Stop losing high-ticket leads to your competitors. Instantly.**

## The Problem
**62% of calls to small businesses go to voicemail.**
When a local lead calls a Med Spa, Dentist, or Contractor, they are looking for an immediate answer. If they hit a voicemail, 80% will hang up without leaving a message and call the next business on Google.

**You aren't just missing a call—you're handing a customer to your competitor.**

## The Solution: Instant Text-Back
Our system monitors your business line. The moment a call is missed, it triggers an intelligent, friendly text message to the caller.

**Example Flow:**
1.  **Lead Calls:** Your front desk is busy or it's after hours.
2.  **Call Missed:** The system detects the missed call in real-time.
3.  **Instant Text (3 Seconds):** *"Hi, this is {{business_name}}! Sorry we missed your call. How can we help you today?"*
4.  **The Result:** The lead stops searching, starts texting you, and you "freeze" the lead before they move to the next Google result.
