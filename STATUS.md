## The Gap Analysis

### Before Today
❌ Brand confusion (2-3 different names)  
❌ No working demo  
❌ No production deployment plan  
❌ No sales materials for Remy Lasers  
❌ Unclear hosting architecture  
❌ Analysis paralysis (too many options)

### After Today
✅ Unified "5 Cypress Automation" brand  
✅ Working demo (tested, 60 seconds)  
✅ Modal deployment ready (serverless, scalable)  
✅ Complete pitch deck + contract  
✅ Clear guidance: Modal, not VPS  
✅ Focused strategy: 1 package, 1 client, repeat
